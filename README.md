basaGC: Apollo Guidance Computer for Kerbal Space Program.
======

This is my reimplementation of the [Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer)
(AGC) and Display/Keyboard (DSKY) for Kerbal Space Program.

Prerequisites:
---

- KSP (tested on 1.0.5), should work on any version that Telemachus works on
- [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-344/)
- [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)
- [Intrepid mod](https://github.com/tcannonfodder/Telemachus/releases/tag/v1.4.32.0) (fork of Telemachus mod) for KSP
- [Mechjeb mod](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2)

Installation:
---
See [doc/installation.md](https://github.com/cashelcomputers/basaGC/blob/master/doc/installation.md)

Running basaGC:
-----

To run basaGC, unzip the download to a folder of your choice. On Linux, in a terminal change to
that directory and type "./basagc.py", on Windows double-click on the file basagc.py.



Please Note! This is a work in progress. Only a few functions of the AGC are implemented. Some buttons and warning
lamps don't work.

Historical note: I have attempted to follow, as closely as possible and with the documentation available to me, the
real life AGC. It should be noted that this is a superficial recreation, not a hard-core simulation of the AGC. Google
"Virtual AGC" for that!

Known issues:
